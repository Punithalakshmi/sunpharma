Mr. Shubham Singh has been selected for The Sun Pharma Science Foundation Science Scholar Award - 2021 for Young Scientists in the field of Biological Sciences. His award-winning work is in the field of lipid metabolism and neurodegeneration. His research was focused on broadly on two aspects: 1) to map lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) lipid metabolism and signaling in the mammalian central nervous system 2) identify molecular mechanisms through which deregulated lyso-PS levels cause neuro-immune diseases like PHARC Syndrome and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. His work expanded our understanding about the physiological relevance of lyso-PS lipids in mammals, and identified crucial druggable targets that can alleviate lyso-PS lipid associated neuro pathological conditions.

            Mr. Sundaram Acharya has been selected Sun Pharma Science Foundation Science Scholar Award - 2021 for the Young Scientists in the field of Biomedical Sciences. His award-winning work is entitled as â€˜Rational design of an enhanced genome editing protein for therapeutic gene correction and diagnosticsâ€™. His research work focuses on the characterization of an intrinsically-specific Cas9 protein from Francisella novicida (FnCas9) which has been used for proof-of-concept therapeutic gene correction and diagnostics. Moreover, he has used protein engineering approach for rational design of FnCas9 which has resulted into enhanced FnCas9 variants (enFnCas9s) with superior cellular editing efficiency and specificity coupled with broad genomic targeting range. This development has paved the way to preclinical studies for correcting sickle cell anemia mutation with a goal to translate it to a therapeutic platform. Broadly, his work has the potential to be the game changer in the field of gene therapy and diagnostics.

Mr. Arihant Kumar Singh
(Ph.D. Research Scholar)

Department of Pharmacy,
Birla Institute of Technology & Science Pilani, Pilani campus,

Mr. Arihant Kumar Singh has been selected for Sun Pharma Science Foundation Science Scholar Award â€“ 2021 for young scientist in field of pharmaceutical science. His award-winning work is entitled by â€œDrug-fatty acids conjugates in diabetes treatment: Role of chain length and degree of unsaturation of fatty acidsâ€. His research work comprised synthesis of different hydrophobic prodrugs by conjugating fatty acids of various chain length and degree of unsaturation with an anti-diabetic drug- Lisofylline & study of their self-assembling nature. Prodrugs has proven their anti-inflammatory effect in MIN6 cells in the presence of cytokines and shown sustained release in rat plasma. The enhancement of chain length significantly increases prodrugsâ€™ t1/2 and steady fasting glucose level with increased insulin level after 35 days of treatment in type 1 diabetic animal model & maintains the beta cells intactness in IHC study. Further, nanoparticulate polymeric tablet dosage form of prodrug makes it better candidate for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.
